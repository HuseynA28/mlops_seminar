Mlopd for beginner 

Run this code in Gitgub codespace to imiatethe cloud systemes 

Initila  start the mlflow with below code (that you can access mlflow from everthjwhere)

Run flow  with  mlflow server   --host 0.0.0.0   --port 5000   --serve-artifacts

Look at the post url and of mlflow and make it Public. 

It sould be something like trhis https://orange-space-halibut-j74q7x57p9x25gv4-5000.app.github.dev/
If it is publica  everthifn can accesss it . 

###
Fast api can use the http://127.0.0.1:5000  or https://orange-space-halibut-j74q7x57p9x25gv4-5000.app.github.dev   to get the model and give teh predication 


### Streamlit 
If  you  would like to deploy the streamlit to cloud  you have to use the github endpoint https://orange-space-halibut-j74q7x57p9x25gv4-5000.app.github.dev   but do not forgte that it is just live a long the gitgub codespalce is alive . If it stops   steamlit cannnot access that . 

Other method is use the drop  the model and deploy the model to Streamlit cold tother with script.
